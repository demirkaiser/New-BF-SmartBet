A program that uses strategies and probability maths to choose the best times to bet on BloxFlip's crash gamemode https://bloxflip.com/crash. <br>
**THIS DOES NOT PREDICT 100% WHEN ITS GOING TO CRASH**: <br>
Instead either it uses a betting strategy or compares the previous crash games to see if it'd be a good idea to bet or to find a good multiplier  <br>

# Configuration and set up ‚öô
To edit the configuration simply go into the config.json file. 
- The multiplier is the point at which the program will auto bet at 
- The bet amount is the amount of robux to bet each time
- Games averaged is the amount of games the program will check (Streakbased only)
- Auto stop is the amount of Robux at which the program will stop betting.
- Auto restart means the program won't ask you to restart betting with your origanal amount when the new increased bet amount is more than your account's balance (Streakbased only)
- Your authorization is the token used on bloxflip to place bets. To get your own auth go onto bloxflip press inspect element and go into the console. Then paste the following code
```
localStorage.getItem('_DO_NOT_SHARE_BLOXFLIP_TOKEN')
```
 This will print your auth token to the console. Copy it without the quotes then put it into the config.json file
